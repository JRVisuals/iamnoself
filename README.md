### Bootstrapped with DCollage (Digital Collage Boilerplate w/ PIXIJS)

The goal of DCollage is to facilitate the creation of multi-layered, interactive, collages similar to those I created back in the days of Flash. Surprise it works for simple games too!

# I AM, No Self

I Am No Self is a digital art project which looks at identity and egolessness through the lens of social media.

## Concept and Mechanics

You can view the creative concept and artist statement here [http://blog.jrvisuals.com/posts/i-am-no-self/](http://blog.jrvisuals.com/posts/i-am-no-self/)

The technology is fairly simple. There is a separate, private, repo with a node.js app that fires up an express server. The web page generated by this repo hits that server which in turn queries Twitter's public search API and returns matching tweets. These tweets are anonymized, sanitized, and cropped then returned as an array to this web page. If this service is not available for any reason this web page will fall back on static data collected over the re-development of this art piece. Note that the original `iamnoself` was created in 2010 and relied on older web technologies. An update was done in 2016 but that still relied on jQuery. This version updates to a relatively current albeit way more verbose tech stack.

## Roadmap

- [] What's next?

### Completed!

- [x] Re-create jQuery version using PIXI

  - [x] display tweets from a local json file
  - [x] wire up live source (created a node.js/express server - this repo is private due to security concerns)
  - [x] make it configurable (aspect ratio and other items are configurable via constants.ts)

## Libraries Used

- PIXIJS - WebGL renderer with Canvas fallback and so much more [https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js)

# Build Scripts

- `yarn start` to go into development mode with live reload
- `yarn clean` to clean the `/dist` directory
- `yarn build` to create a distributable bundle in `/dist`
- `yarn docs` to generate markdown documentation in `/docs`

# The Stack

- Pixi.JS
- TypeScript
